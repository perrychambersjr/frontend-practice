## My process
I followed the same process for the most part as the product-preview challenge. This time again it went quicker and smoother while using flexbox. Some of the things that hung me up was vertical spacing with the top image. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Continued building with flexbox.

### Continued development

Continue to use flexbox, integrate more media queries for full responsiveness.
