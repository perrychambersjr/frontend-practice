## My process
This process was mostly the same as what I did for the browser-extension-ui. I got all of the components made and styled with light mode first. This included respoonsiveness, after light/dark mode toggle logic was implemented I was basically done. There was no logic to be done this time which made it faster and easier than the browser extension.
